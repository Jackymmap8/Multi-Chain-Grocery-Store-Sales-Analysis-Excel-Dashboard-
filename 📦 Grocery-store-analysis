# 🛒 Multi-Chain Grocery Store Sales Analysis (Excel Dashboard)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of 1,980+ transactions across multiple grocery store chains (MegaMart, GreenGrocer, ValuePlus, etc.). Using Excel, 
I performed data cleaning, handled financial anomalies, and built an interactive dashboard to visualize sales trends and store efficiency.

The project demonstrates end-to-end data analytics skills including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, KPI development, and dashboard storytelling —
suitable for stakeholder presentations and portfolio review.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
The following steps were performed in Excel:

- Converted raw data into structured Excel Tables
- Standardized date and currency formats
      transaction_date → Date
      quantity, unit_price, discount_amount → Number
      store_name, aisle → Text

- Identified and handled negative or invalid final amounts
Created a helper column:
      =IF(final_amount<0,"Review","OK")

- Validated total amounts using quantity × unit price
- Removed duplicate records
- Created time-based fields (Year, Month, Year-Month) for trend analysis
        Year	=YEAR(transaction_date)
        Month	=TEXT(transaction_date,"mmm")
        Discount %	=discount_amount / total_amount
        Revenue Flag	=IF(final_amount>0,"Valid","Error")
