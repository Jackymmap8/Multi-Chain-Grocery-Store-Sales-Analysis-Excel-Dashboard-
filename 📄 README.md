**A Data Analysis Project focused on Retail Performance and Customer Insights**

## 📊 Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of 2,000+ transactions across multiple grocery store chains (MegaMart, GreenGrocer, ValuePlus, etc.). Using Excel, I performed data cleaning, handled financial anomalies, and built an interactive dashboard to visualize sales trends and store efficiency.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills
* **Excel:** Power Query (Data Cleaning), Pivot Tables (Data Aggregation).
* **Visualization:** Interactive Slicers, Timeline Filters, Pivot Charts.
* **Data Integrity:** Handling negative revenue, date standardization, and deduplication.

## 📂 Files Included
* grocery_chain_data.csv /`: Contains the raw CSV and the finalized cleaned Excel dataset.
* `grocery_dashboard.xls/`: The core Excel file containing the interactive dashboard.
* `Documentation/`: Detailed Data Dictionary explaining the 11 key metrics.

## 🔍 Business Questions Answered
1.  **Which store leads in revenue?** (Insight: GreenGrocer Plaza is the top performer).
2.  **How do discounts impact the bottom line?** (Insight: Identified transactions where discounts exceeded item price).
3.  **Which aisles have the highest foot traffic?** (Insight: Produce and Dairy drive 40% of all sales).
